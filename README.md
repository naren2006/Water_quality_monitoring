Water Quality Monitoring â€“ AI Prediction System

A machine learning project to predict **Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)** in water using Linear Regression and Random Forest. The system cleans sensor data,
handles missing values, and provides visualizations to support early detection of water contamination.

Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualizations).
